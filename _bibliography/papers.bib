    Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a framework for optimizing a decision-maker's latent preferences over available design choices. While preferences often involve multiple conflicting objectives, existing work in PBO assumes that preferences can be encoded by a single objective function. For example, in robotic assistive devices, technicians often attempt to maximize user comfort while simultaneously minimizing mechanical energy consumption for longer battery life. Similarly, in autonomous driving policy design, decision-makers wish to understand the trade-offs between multiple safety and performance attributes before committing to a policy. To address this gap, we propose the first framework for PBO with multiple objectives. Within this framework, we present dueling scalarized Thompson sampling (DSTS), a multi-objective generalization of the popular dueling Thompson algorithm, which may be of interest beyond the PBO setting. We evaluate DSTS across four synthetic test functions and two simulated exoskeleton personalization and driving policy design tasks, showing that it outperforms several benchmarks. Finally, we prove that DSTS is asymptotically consistent. As a direct consequence, this result provides, to our knowledge, the first convergence guarantee for dueling Thompson sampling in the PBO setting.

  abstract= {Facial paralysis is an increasingly prevalent condition characterized by the loss of voluntary muscle activity mainly on one side of the face, resulting from various causes such as Bell's palsy, viral infections, stroke, and trauma. This condition manifests as asymmetry in the mouth and eyes, often causing significant cosmetic and functional impairments, including oral dysfunction, muscle contractures, nasal obstruction, and synkinesis. The psychological and neurological impact on patients can also be profound, affecting interpersonal relationships.Recent advancements in personalized rehabilitation have highlighted the effectiveness of facial acupoint massage, which significantly enhances clinical outcomes by improving recovery times and reducing complications. However, research on the precise localization of massage acupoints tailored to the individual's condition and rehabilitation stage is limited, leading to a gap in personalized treatment strategies.This study aims to address these gaps by developing a personalized assisted rehabilitation method based on acupoint massage for patients with facial paralysis. Utilizing traditional Chinese medicine principles, we analyze the relationship between specific facial acupoints and clinical symptoms of facial paralysis. By targeting specific acupoints, the massage aims to restore muscle and nerve function on the affected side. Additionally, we employ image technology and a transformation matrix method for six primary massage acupoints (Yangbai, Zanzhu, Sibai, Yingxiang, Jiache, and Dicang) to achieve precise acupoint localization relative to key facial contours (eyes, nose, mouth) on the affected side. Our findings indicate changes in main acupoint positions such as the Sibai and Dicang, necessitating tailored massage methods. For instance, a case study involving a photograph of an adult male with right facial paralysis shows rotational deviations of the right eye and the corner of the mouth counterclockwise by 10° and 15°, respectively. Thus, the research reveals that in massage rehabilitation for facial paralysis patients, the positions of the Sibai and Dicang acupoints shift horizontally by 4.5mm and 1mm, and vertically by 0.4mm and 8.1mm, respectively. By comparing the shape similarity between healthy and affected faces, we also propose a segmented massage strategy to adjust the intensity and frequency of massages at different stages of rehabilitation. Our approach provides targeted training in facial acupoint massage rehabilitation. It not only offers clinical guidance for the treatment of facial paralysis but also helps minimize the sequelae associated with the condition.}

  abstract={The paper presents a novel soft body morphing quadcopter capable of multi-mode motion and adaptive shape transformation, offering enhanced interaction with complex and unstructured environments compared to conventional rigid designs, inspired by the characteristics of biological soft body. The quadcopter features a starfish-shaped soft Mylar membrane as its structural base, with four distributed propulsion systems at the corners and a centralized control unit. This configuration enables dynamic deformation and responsive adaptation during flight. By applying thin plate deformation theory and aerodynamic principles, we analyzed the nonlinear relationship between motor thrust and structural deformation, and established deformation models of the soft body based on four corner loading and cantilever beam assumptions. These models underpin the quadcopter’s unique motion capabilities. Analyses and experimental tests confirm the feasibility of three distinct motion modes: planar omnidirectional movement, deformation flight, and wing-like flapping motion. The system achieves basic flight functions, including hovering and controlled deformation, while exhibiting a high deformation ratio and shape adaptability. Unlike traditional rigid-body quadcopters, this soft-body morphing design enables navigation through tight spaces, tolerance to collisions, and the ability to land on irregular surfaces, which are critical for deployment in cluttered or uncertain environments and beyond the reach of rigid-body aerial systems.},
