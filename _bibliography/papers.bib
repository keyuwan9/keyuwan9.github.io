    Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a framework for optimizing a decision-maker's latent preferences over available design choices. While preferences often involve multiple conflicting objectives, existing work in PBO assumes that preferences can be encoded by a single objective function. For example, in robotic assistive devices, technicians often attempt to maximize user comfort while simultaneously minimizing mechanical energy consumption for longer battery life. Similarly, in autonomous driving policy design, decision-makers wish to understand the trade-offs between multiple safety and performance attributes before committing to a policy. To address this gap, we propose the first framework for PBO with multiple objectives. Within this framework, we present dueling scalarized Thompson sampling (DSTS), a multi-objective generalization of the popular dueling Thompson algorithm, which may be of interest beyond the PBO setting. We evaluate DSTS across four synthetic test functions and two simulated exoskeleton personalization and driving policy design tasks, showing that it outperforms several benchmarks. Finally, we prove that DSTS is asymptotically consistent. As a direct consequence, this result provides, to our knowledge, the first convergence guarantee for dueling Thompson sampling in the PBO setting.

  abstract= abstract={The paper presents a novel soft body morphing quadcopter capable of multi-mode motion and adaptive shape transformation, offering enhanced interaction with complex and unstructured environments compared to conventional rigid designs, inspired by the characteristics of biological soft body. The quadcopter features a starfish-shaped soft Mylar membrane as its structural base, with four distributed propulsion systems at the corners and a centralized control unit. This configuration enables dynamic deformation and responsive adaptation during flight. By applying thin plate deformation theory and aerodynamic principles, we analyzed the nonlinear relationship between motor thrust and structural deformation, and established deformation models of the soft body based on four corner loading and cantilever beam assumptions. These models underpin the quadcopter’s unique motion capabilities. Analyses and experimental tests confirm the feasibility of three distinct motion modes: planar omnidirectional movement, deformation flight, and wing-like flapping motion. The system achieves basic flight functions, including hovering and controlled deformation, while exhibiting a high deformation ratio and shape adaptability. Unlike traditional rigid-body quadcopters, this soft-body morphing design enables navigation through tight spaces, tolerance to collisions, and the ability to land on irregular surfaces, which are critical for deployment in cluttered or uncertain environments and beyond the reach of rigid-body aerial systems.},
